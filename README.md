## Simulation of organisms evolution using neuroevolution

Project is in early stage of development and is deployed here for testing purposes: http://woe.azurewebsites.net/. 

For now, simplified vesrion of predator-prey simulation was created. Organisms (blue) are trying to learn how to find food (green). If they do not find it in time they will die. Every organism represents one neural network and every few seconds new generation of organisms is created from best individuals, mutating their neaural networks.

We plan to expand behavior of organisms just as comunications beeween each other and also add more type fo organisms. We also plan to add user interaction.
